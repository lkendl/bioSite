<b>CALIFORNIA – 1989</b>

<p>In April of 1989, Patrich “Kendtendo” Kendl was born. As a young boy, Patrich was like most other kids his age: he loved playing outside, going to the park, and of course, playing video games. His first memory of gaming goes back to when he was four years old. “My Mom and Dad would play Doctor Mario on the NES,” he recalls.</p>

<p>A few years passed when his family acquired the Super Nintendo. “My mom worked at a Video Vault in San Diego,” Patrich shares. “At the end of her shift, I would go to the game section and rent any game I wanted.” His favorites? Ninja Turtle’s Tournament Fighters and Maximum Carnage: Spider-Man.</p>

<p>Patrich was gifted his first gaming console when he turned nine years old: a GameBoy Color in Clear Atomic Purple (which he still owns today, though the speaker died when a chocolate chip melted into it). His first GameBoy game was Pokémon Blue Version.</p>

<p><b>WASHINGTON – 2000</b></p>

<p>Patrich moved to Washington when he was eleven. He received his high school diploma in 2007. During his high school years, he participated in wrestling, football, and track & field. After graduation, Patrich found a job at a local movie theater. He fondly remembers times during the fall (when kids were back at school) that he would hook up his Xbox 360 to the theater projector to play Grand Theft Auto. When he wasn’t working, Patrich was hard at work on his college degree. </p>

<p><b>FLORIDA- 2013</b></p>

<p>By the time Patrich turned 20 years old, he had left his job at the theater and finished his Associate’s degree. He decided to join the Navy when he was 23, where his rate was (appropriately) an Information Technician. At Navy “A” school in Pensacola, Florida, he met his future wife, Laura. She recalls that she was standing in line to donate blood when she heard someone talking about Pokémon. She was intrigued and turned around to talk to the guy talking about Pokémon with someone else. This guy was Patrich. </p>

<p>They dated shortly after, and both graduated from Navy “A” and “C” school. Patrich had orders to Washington, and his girlfriend had orders to Hawaii. During a visit to Hawaii, Patrich proposed to Laura, and they both married in 2014. Patrich got relocation orders to Hawaii. They enjoyed many years of Final Fantasy IV, Pokémon, and Overwatch together (while eating the most ridiculously delicious sushi and going on incredible hikes). At age 28, Patrich and his wife had their first child, a daughter named Ellie. </p>

<p><b>MONTANA- 2020</b></p>

<p>When his orders were up in Hawaii, Patrich and his family moved to San Diego, CA. His wife left the Navy to take care of their daughter. Patrich enjoyed taking his family to the zoo and to SeaWorld, which they did quite often. </p>

<p>The day that COVID was declared a pandemic, Patrich’s wife gave birth to their second daughter, Jennie. Patrich separated from the Navy after he completed his orders, and he and his family moved to Montana, where he now has a job in construction.  </p>

<p><b><i>Today, you can find Patrich playing Overwatch most nights or watching Modern Family with his wife.</b></i></p>
